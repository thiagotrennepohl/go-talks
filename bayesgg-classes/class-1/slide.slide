Thiago Trennepohl

* Agenda

- Why Golang & What are going to learn?
- Golang setup
- Basic algorithms
- Exercises

* Disclaimer

Broken english ahead!

* Course duration

- 5 weeks for the basics
- Unlimited for careers and building systems

* Why Golang?
Golang is easy to learn, easy to code and easy to solve real world problems

Also golang COC (Code of conduct) is amazing!

* Go community COC

- Be friendly and welcoming
- Be patient
- Be thoughtful
- Be respectful
- Be charitable
- Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
- Avoid destructive behavior

* Go community COC

* What are we going to learn?

- Basics of programming logic
- Types and variables 
- Decision Structures
- Logic Operators
- Vectors and Matrixes
- Functions (not f(x)=something)

* Golang setup


* What are algorithms?

Algorithms are steps/rules set in a logic order aiming to solve a problem.

* What are algorithms?

How different is the previous statement to a cake recipe? the problem?

* What are algorithms
- Step 1 -> Preheat oven to 350F
- Step 2 -> In the bowl of a stand mixer (or in a large bowl using an electric mixer) cream together the butter.
- Step 3 -> ...
- Last step -> eat the whole cake alone.

* How would you do to change a car tire?

2 - Get the Jack (Auto-Affe) 
3 - Put the jack under the car
4 - Loose the screws
5 - Lift the car
6 - Change the tire
7 - Lower the car
8 - Tighten the screws
9 - Put back the flat tire and jack into the trunk
10 - Be happy

* What about a sum?
