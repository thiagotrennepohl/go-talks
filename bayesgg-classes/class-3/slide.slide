Bayesgg Gophers
3nd meeting - Slices and Loops

Thiago Trennepohl

* Slices

Slices are similar to arrays, the difference is in the internals...

While arrays have a fixed lenght, slices provide us a way to resize arrays and a few more things.

Arrays are indexable collections of data, similar to a Book's index where you can quickly access the book content by its "address".
An array element also have an index which can be used to access its value.

you can find more at :

* Slices
Slices can be declared like this:

  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main(){
    var alphabet []string
  }

In this case alphabet is a empty list of strings

* Slices
But you can also declare them like this:

  package main

  import "fmt"

  func main(){
    alphabet := []string{"a","b","c","d","e"}
  }

And here alphabet is a list of 5 strings.
You can check the lenght of an array with:

    len(alphabet)

Remember! a slice index starts in 0

* Slices
As said in the first slide, a value can be accessed by its index:

.play slices.go


* Slices
A nice thing that you can do with Slices is to slice them :D
E.g I want to print the elements from index 0 to 3

.play slicing.go


* Slices
The syntax

  alphabet[:4]

Means that I'm getting elements from the 1st position(index 0) to the 4th position(index 3).

What if I want from the 2nd element(index 1) to the 4th element(index 3)?

It would be like this:

  fmt.Println(alphabet[1:4])

The number before the colon is inclusive and the number after the colon is exclusive


* Loops

As we seen before, in golang you can loop lists in two ways:

1:
.play for.go

* Loops

In golang you can loop lists in two ways:

2:
.play range.go

* Exercises

What does the code below do?

.code ex1.go


* Exercises

Using slices, improve the calculator exercise (previous class) to allow the user to input more numbers


* Exercises
Write a program that registers users/people information and at the end you should print the "screen" below
